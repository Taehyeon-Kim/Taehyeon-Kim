## 👋 Hi, I'm Taehyeon Kim
![Badge](https://hitscounter.dev/api/hit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FTaehyeon-Kim&label=visitors&icon=github&color=%233d8bfd)

I'm currently focused on building domain-specific AI agents  
using Python, LangChain, and LangGraph.

- 🤖 Interested in autonomous agents and LLM applications  
- 🛒 Previously worked on full-stack e-commerce web development  
- 🍎 Started out with iOS development and mobile-focused dev clubs

These days, I'm less focused on specific technologies  
and more interested in solving real-world problems.
